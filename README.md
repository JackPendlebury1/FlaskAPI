# FlaskAPI
## Backend files for flask for a movie app i was creating
_this was one of my first full applications_
_I was using this to better understand how to connect a webpage to make requests to a backend.
**I chose flask because its lightweight and easy to understand**
_I decided not to go further with flask for web development_
### My focus turn to fast api and serverless applications, creating microservices.
